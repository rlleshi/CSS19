His \"selected discography\" is so poor it actually looks comprehensive, and the novels he has translated are all low-tier. He's basically a regular translator with a niche, who also happens to be a jazz drummer that has occasionnally performed with some bigger names. Also his website, \"a collaboration with over 50 international entities\" (whatever that means), doesn't even work. I'm not saying he cannot be proud of his cultural input, but this is far too little for an encyclopedic entry; especially when it looks like a poorly written cover letter.\n",

Miki Filigranski is the original author of a very long and extensive bashing of the entire Frankopan family over this name change on all three of their Wikipedia pages - Ingrid Detter de Frankopan, her son Peter Frankopan, and her daughter Lady Nicholas Windsor. For years, Wikipedia editors have been removing it from all three pages for bias and relevance only to have Miki put it back up again repeatedly. I cut it down severely on all the pages a few months ago, but frankly, it should come down entirely on all the articles. It is irrelevant, and the fact that it was illegal to use a noble title without authorization in a now-defunct Empire 200 years ago has nothing to do with this family today - they only made the name change within the last 20 years, and it is completely legal for them to do so.\n",

      "                   As David Eppstein said, there has been NO \"fraud\" committed and again, you cannot make slanderous statements like that about the Frankopans in an encyclopedia when they are not supported by cold facts. Your \"reliable sources\" don't support half the statements you have made in these articles that you attach them to, and in particular your long and often-irrelevant statements in the Frankopan Family article. Much of what you have to say there is merely your biased opinion, which is not permitted in an encyclopedia article: you cannot, for example, say that Louis' cousin denounced him in order \"to save the reputation of the family name\". Or that Ingrid \"influenced with false information the publishing of a book with the intention to distort history about these two families\" - as you are not inside her head, you have no idea what her \"intentions\" were, even if you had actual proof that she \"influenced with false information\", which is not supported by the source. And you cannot make blatantly biased and slanted comments like \"members of de Lupis family managed to get presented [to the Pope] not by their original name yet as Frankopans\" - that clearly has a negative slant and is therefore not a neutral POV. Yes, all of that is indeed \"bashing\". You are arguing with two editors right now who are telling you that your edits are not acceptable. And if you look up above, at least one other editor in this same section has also said that your \"genealogy\" comments need to be deleted. Perhaps you should consider that you are not correct, and everyone else wrong.\n",

      "2. \"Loudly complaining\": I expressed my frustration that a user was making changes and saying the site violated a rule but then wouldn't tell me what the violation was.  It seems like a big game as opposed to just working collaboratively to solve a problem.\n",
      "3. The Book I wrote: You angrily say I \"shamelessly\" promote the book.  Well, that's what authors do. They promote their books. I guess Apple shamelessly promotes phone. No further comment necessary. I guess that goes for the various articles I have authored or co-authored. Can’t cite them either.\n",
      "4.  I'd love to have more sources for information on the site, but your rules also say pages cannot look like marketing. Much of the information out there about lawyers, whomever writes it, speaks to the ability of their work.  You'd consider that marketing, so what's a business supposed to do? You mention Law360, for example. I just checked Law360 and around 100 articles have mentioend our firm on that one cite. Am I supposed to list them all so Wiki can see we're a relevant enterprise?\n",
      "5. The firm is based in Oakland. It does have 3 attorneys today. I never said it didn't. We had 4 a couple of weeks ago, and we’ve had 7-9 in the past. We may have 4-5 in a few weeks. We have a core team but then it changes often depending on a lot of circumstances. I never contested this point though, and I still don't think Wiki really understands the nature of my complaint. As to the number of attorneys, someone recently put that info in the site, meaning we’ll have to change it often (we’d really rather not have to update the page that much). Clearly, a user wants us to look irrelevant.\n",
      "6. All this negativity to the page and my comments feels very punitive (either due to our profession as attorneys or because we dared to contest something a Wiki user did). I am not an expert at using Wiki but just want to get the information correct on this page. I don't appreciate users trying to make diminutive comments (\"e.g., \"the little town of Concord\") about an office that's done more for California workers than almost any firm out there, nor is it fair that we have to give citations for things like what causes we support, or pro bono work (do I really have to cite cases?), our office location when Wiki does not requires that of any other pages.\n",
